Background: 

The leading causes of death in the US are cardiovascular disease and cancer. A significant portion of these deaths are caused by lifestyle choices. In efforts to inspire long term behavioral change and reduce these staggering statistics, we are creating LifeTime, a web application to inspire healthy life choices and offer a way to personalize the direct impact of daily lifestyle decisions as they pertain to diet and exercise. 

Description of application:

Users log in with Jawbone, [Link to Jawbone](https://jawbone.com/). With the step data from Jawbone, users can see a graphical display of how their life style choices impact their health and longevity. Users are able to see a clock that displays how much time has been added or subtracted to their life based on the physical activity and nutritional data from Jawbone.
